Analysis on ACT and SAT

Problem Statement:

An examination of trends in SAT and ACT participation rates along with aggregate scores for 2017 and 2018. Participation rates for these tests vary greatly by state, I aim to uncover underlying patterns in order to make recommendations for a suitable states to improve SAT participation rates.

Overview of the steps taken to reach my conclusion:

Step 1 - Import and identify abnormalities in the data.

Step 2 - Clean the data.

Step 3 - Merge the data.

Step 4 - Data exploration.

Step 5 - Visualize the data.

Step 6 - Describe any findings.

Step 7 - Conclude.


Conclusion:

From the above anylysis, it is clearly indicated a distinct rivalry between the SAT and ACT participation rates, with ACT clearly leading the race whilst SAT improving over the year with its participation rates. There is a decrease in total scoring for the SATs in America, but participation rates have somewhat remained consistent.

North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, Connecticut,Delaware and Idaho are states that have the least participating rate for the SATs

There are many states with mandatory ACT and SAT examinations. High participation rates in a particular test usually leads to low scores in the test, as well as low participation rates in the other test.


Recommendations:

1) To further encourage the switch to the SAT, free tests should be offered to select schools which may be resistant to the idea to help ease the pain of transition and get students accustomed to the SAT.

1) The SAT can be offered for free or discounted to students at both the state level and the municipal - even if a state doesn't provide for all, individual school districts are able to offer free SAT admission for local citizens.
